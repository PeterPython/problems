Pogo Dog (800 pts)
Problem
In an ill-conceived attempt to enhance the mobility of his prize dog Doggo, Skip has attached a pogo stick to each of Doggo's legs. Doggo can now hop around quickly throughout the farm, but she has not yet learned how to slow down.

To help train Doggo to hop with greater control, Skip sets up a practice course for her along a straight one-dimensional path across his farm. At various distinct positions on the path, he places N targets on which Doggo should try to land. Target i is located at position X_i, and is worth P_i points if Doggo lands on it. Doggo starts at the location of any target of her choosing and is allowed to move in only one direction, hopping from target to target. Each hop must cover at least as much distance as the previous hop, and must land on a target.

Doggo receives credit for every target she touches (including the initial target on which she starts).  Please compute the maximum number of points she can obtain.  

Input
The first line of the input file contains the number of cases, T. T test cases follow.
Each test case starts with a single integer, N. The next N lines contain two space separated integers X_i and P_i.

Sample Input
1
6
5 6
1 1
10 5
7 6
4 8
8 10

Output
For each test case, output a line with the maximum number of points Doggo can receive.

Sample Output
25


Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= X_i, P_i <= 1,000,000
