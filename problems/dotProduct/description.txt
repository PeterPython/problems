Given two sparse Vectors, compute the Dot Product.
Input Format : The first line will contain two numbers(k and n), which are the number of entries for the two vectors respectively.
The next k lines are the entries for the first vector, of the form : x y
where x is the position and y is the value at that position in the vector.
The n lines are the entries of the second vector.
Any entries not specified indicate zero at that position.
The two vectors will always be of the same length

Example input:
3 3
1 4
4 2
5 3
1 7
2 6
5 1

Sample Answer: Dot Product = 4*7+3*1 = 31 (only print 31)
